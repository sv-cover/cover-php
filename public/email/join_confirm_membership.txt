    <p>Dear $first_name,</p>

    <p>Please confirm your email address to complete your membership application. Click this link to continue:</p>

    <p><a href="$link|markup_format_attribute">Confirm your email address</a></p>

    <p>After this step, your account will be made and you will receive a link to setup your account. And if everything goes according to plan, you will also be able to make purchases in the KAST system in our room.</p>

    <p>Some functions that are only accessible for members, will be enabled after the secretary has confirmed and processed your registration. But that shouldnâ€™t take too long :)</p>

    <p>Kind regards,</p>

    <p>Cover</p>
