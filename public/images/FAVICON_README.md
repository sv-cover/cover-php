# Cover Favicons (and other icons)

For all icons, the vector source is provided as `.svg` file, so it can be edited if desired. The 32×32px and 64×64px favicons have been modified to be pixel "perfect". In this case, the vector shape of the 'C' has been modified to line up with the pixel grid, so it looks extra crisp. Therefore, these versions will not scale up to be identical to eachother and the medium-size favicon.
