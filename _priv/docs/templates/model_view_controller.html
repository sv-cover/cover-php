<p>The CoVer website is setup in a model/view/controller design pattern. This
means that the different functions of the website have a clean split in
modelling the data (#data_model), viewing the data (what the client sees) and 
controlling the data (what the server does with user requests).</p>

<p>An easy to understand example of this concept is a web form which inserts
an entry in the database. The model here is all the functions reading and
writing from and to the database. The view is the actual web form and the
controller is that part of the code processing the form variables and call
functions of the model to insert something in the database.</p>

<p>These three components are separated pieces of code. The model and the
controller are not theme dependent but the view is. The model files
can be found in <i>include/data</i> and the controller files are simply 
the files in the html root directory (the ones the client requests). For the
views it's a different story. Since views are themed they can be found in
<i>themes/[name]/views</i>. How views and themes are handled is described
in #themes.</p>
