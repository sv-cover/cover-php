<p>Views are a very important part of the website. They provide the 
graphical user interface (what the client sees) using the data provided
by the #data_model. Views are located in 
<span class="highlight">themes/name/views</span>.</p>

<p>A view file may define multiple views. This can be used to group views
together (for instance views that use the same model). Every view has its
own function:</p>

<div class="code">
view_<span class="highlight">name</span> (
model, 
iter, 
params
)</div>

<table class="arguments">
<tr>
	<td valign="top" class="param_name">model</td>
	<td class="right">:</td>
	<td class="param_desc">the #DataModel for this view</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top" class="param_name">iter</td>
	<td class="right">:</td>
	<td class="param_desc">the #DataIter to be used by this view</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top" class="param_name">params</td>
	<td class="right">:</td>
	<td class="param_desc">a hash containing additional parameters</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These functions simply <span class="highlight">echo</span> whatever needs to send to the client.</p>

<p>Views can be used by using the #run_view function (located in 
<span class="highlight">include/functions.php</span>).
