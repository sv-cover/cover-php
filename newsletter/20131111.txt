### MeisCie: Ballroom and Latin Dancing
Date:
Monday 25 November  
Time: 17:00  
Location: To be announced  

The
MeisCie has something special in store for you. For our first activity
this year we have prepared a dancing lesson. We're not talking about
dance moves you'll see at the Mambo Jambo or the Negende Cirkel. We're
talking about ballroom and latin dancing! We'll teach you the basic
steps of the chachacha and the quick step. For the chachacha we have
prepared a few additions to make the dance more interesting. We all
hope to see you and hope you'll have a good time dancing!

###
StudCie: Lunch Lecture TNO
Date: Wednesday 20 November  
Time: 13:00 

Location: Room 5173.0151, Linaeusborg  

TNO will be giving a lecture
on both information security and home automation.

First, Gerben
Broenink will show the possibilities for injecting malware into
existing android applications. He will be using a manipulated Angry
Birds app during the demo to gain control of a smartphone.

Second,
Wilco Wijbrandi will show the FlexiblePower Application Infrastructure
(FPAI), which is a home automation platform which can connect with all
the smart devices in your home. This platform can be used to install
applications that control your devices or connect with the smart
grid.

If you want a free lunch, you have to register at [our
website](http://studcie.svcover.nl).

### New newsletter
Hopefully you have
already noticed that this newsletter differs a lot from the previous
one. Because we were busy designing our new newsletter, we moved this
newsletter from one week ago to this Monday. The next newsletter will
be sent two weeks from now.

### New committee
We have a new
committee! The BHVcie is now a real committee and in this newsletter
we would like to inform you about this matter.

The BHVcie has two
main tasks. They have to provide BHV’ers (ERO’s in Dutch) for
relevant events. They also have to maintain the first aid kits. So if
you need a BHV’er for an event, you can mail the committee at
bhv@svcover.nl and they will provide the amount of BHV’ers needed.


The people in this committee are Annemarie Galetzka, Bastiaan van
Loon, Davey Schilling and Eveline Broers. Soon we will also have a
fifth member for the committee.

### Idea submission station
In the
last couple of weeks also our new website launched:
[idee.svcover.nl](http://idea.svcover.nl)! You can use it when you
suddenly have inspiration. The ideas will be discussed during our
board meeting.
