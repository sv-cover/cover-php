    - [×] forum/thread_form.twig
    - [×] mailinglijsten/archive_single.twig
    - [×] show/form.twig

## Bulma extensions / custom CSS

- [-] [issue] Vertically padded container. Sometimes a container element for vertical grouping would be nice.
    - [×] Pagination bar in:
        - [×] forum/forum.twig
        - [×] forum/thread.twig
        - [×] weblog/index.twig
    - [×] Poll in forum/_poll.twig
    - [×] Search statistics in search/index.twig.
    - [×] Individual parts of commissies/archive.twig

    - [×] header in mailinglists/archive_single.twig

    - [×] entire form in lidworden/lidworden.twig
    - [ ] article on any profile page

    - [ ] article anywhere basically
- [×] [issue] Divider (like the one of semantic ui)
    - [×] \_layout/401.twig
    - [×] sessions/_login_widget.twig (to separate the form from the become a member button)
    - [×] boeken/go_to_login.twig
    - [×] lidworden/known_member.twig
    - [×] lidworden/pending.twig
-   [×] Non-hidden mobile navbar options (like search, login, apps, hamburger). A bit like JFV does it (or Google)
- [×] [issue] Narrow content container for improved readability. 
- [ ] [issue] TOC sidebar.
- [ ] Almanak rendering. Last row is weird, images are not centered.
    - [ ] almanak/index.twig
    - [ ] commissies/_leden.twig
    - [ ] commissies/working_groups.twig
- [×] Tabs in form field (for preview rendering) should be closer to field in:
    - [×] forum/poll_form.twig
    - [×] forum/reply_form.twig
    - [×] forum/thread_form.twig
    - [×] agenda/form.twig:
    - [×] announcements/form.twig
    - [×] show/form.twig
    - [×] signup/configuration/editable.twig
- [×] [issue] Bulma typography is inconsistent across a single page.
- [×] [issue] Fieldset in: 
    - [×] sessions/overrides.twig
    - [×] signup/fields/choice.twig
- [ ] Calendar icon in:
    - [ ] agenda/index.twig
    - [ ] agenda/single.twig
    - [ ] commissies/_agenda.twig
    - [ ] search/\_single_agendapunt.twig
- [×] [issue] Bulma dl styling is ugly
- [×] [issue] Multiple select is broken
    - [×] committeebattle\form.twig
- [×] Static button disables title attribute (css: `pointer-events: none`). Fix this or find something better for photobook visibility in book icons.
- [×] Lines of media objects are not always wished for, especially in nested media objects.
    - [×] comments on photobook main page
- [ ] A bootstrap style "link" button may be desired
    - [×] like button in photo book comments, has to be button because form. But the rest are true links. Looks fine now, except on hover.
    - [×] like button on photo
    - [ ] Fix by making everything buttons
- [ ] [issue] Level-right doesn't work if there's no level-left
- [ ] [issue] Same for pagination
    - [ ] weblog/index.twig

    - [×] fotoboek/\_path.twig
    - [×] fotoboek/single.twig
    - [×] fotoboekreacties/\_comment.twig
- [×] [issue] No margin around dropdown in .buttons. No use .field.is-grouped instead (see bulma doc).
    - [×] agenda/index.twig
- [×] Why does a .number make form elements rounded? Bulma legacy, apparently. Don't use .number.
- [×] A table-responsive like element would be nice (or probably an .is-scrollable modifier)
    - [×] signup/list_entries.twig
- [ ] A is-truncated (white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis;) would be nice.
    - [ ] signup/list_entries.twig
- [×] Buttons don't work that well as card-footer-item
    - [×] signup/form_form.twig
- [×] fullwidth/expanding select? maybe? - Already exists. `.is-fullwidth` works.
- [×] Buttons don't work as dropdown-item
    - [×] fotoboek/photobook.twig (manage dropdown for photocee)
- [×] Button addons spacing between last 2 is broken. See 
    - [×] fotoboek/photobook.twig (download + mark as seen)


## Other

- [ ] Remove profile signature, it isn't used and didn't fit in the design
- [ ] Remove language switch from profile
- [ ] Almanac form is weird. May need some backend improvements (filter on filter). 
- [ ] Titles in pages behave weird. Maybe some backend improvements?
- [×] Transpose columns in session/overrides.twig and committeebattle/form.twig
- [ ] Former boards page is weird / unintuitive. Best solution: improve committees/groups and make it more automated.
- [×] Old committee page was better. But at least it's bulma now :)
- [ ] Single committee page is crap now.
- [ ] Working groups page needs major redesign.
- [×] Photo origin path in fotoboek/\_path.twig is ugly html.
- [×] Redesign photobook: rendering of books could be better. May need some backend changes. 
- [-] Photo modal still needs to be implemented, and better than in the previous design (more mobile friendly).
- [ ] Consistent HTML structure (how to use headers, article footer etc)
- [ ] Embedded mailing list form doesn't seem to work…
- [ ] Fix select fields
- [ ] Find a better implementation for agenda/signup_form.twig. Box clearly doesn't work, but I can't get card or panel to work convincingly :(
- [ ] Move Headings inside of articles, unless header. Got to do proper HTML5 :)
- [ ] Error 500. What if link_static is broken? Or i18n?
- [ ] Poll on mobile doesn't work that well.
- [×] Photo privacy form doesn't return to original photo
- [ ] Sanity check disabled InlineAction
- [ ] Auto-save indicator
- [ ] InlineAction destination fade
- [ ] AutoSubmitForm feedback
- [ ] Confirmation before signup entry deletion
- [ ] Sort out cookie policy (dark mode + calendar mode + remember me)
- [ ] Add rel="noopener noreferrer" to all target="blank" links
- [ ] Full reduced motion support

# Pending Design Decisions

- [ ] Standardise edit/delete/whatever buttons (announcements vs forum vs editable)
- [ ] If a committee member stops being a member, they are invisible to non-admins on the committee page. Is this a good idea?
- [ ] How to display metadata? Eg. forum messages, announcements, search results, photo album
- [ ] Icons in buttons?
- [ ] How to do subnavigation in mailinglists? Current solution doesn't have h1 (needed for sr)
- [ ] Deprecate horizontal banner rotator?
- [ ] Redesign inclusion process (lidworden)
- [ ] Notification system?
