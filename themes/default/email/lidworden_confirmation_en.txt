Dear $first_name,

Your registration is almost complete. To confirm your e-mail address, please click the following link:

https://www.svcover.nl/lidworden.php?confirmation_code=$confirmation_code

After this step, your account will be made and you will receive your password. And if everything goes according to plan, you will also be able to buy purchases in KAST in our member room.

Some functions, such as the member information and photo books that are only accessible for members, are enabled after the secretary has confirmed and processed your registration. But that shouldn't take too long :)

Kind regards,

The AC/DCee
